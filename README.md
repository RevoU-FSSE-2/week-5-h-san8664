1. Connect your account to Netlify !

The first step to deploy in Netlify is creating a new account or use existing account. As a beginner progammer, I would prefer using GitHub account instead.

After you successfully login, you will be redirected to dashboard of Netlify app. In this scenario, you will need to import your existing project from github to netlify. Add new site -> Import existing project -> Connect via GitHub

2. Auto Deploy with Netlify !

One of the benefit using your GitHub account connected to Netlify is that you don't have to worry about re-deploying your project manually, once there are changes that have been pushed in your repository, it will automatically re-deployed by Netlify within second.

4. Modify your project with favorite customize domain !

You're on the final step to bringing live your project with custom domain. Go to dashboard Cloudfire -> DNS Records -> CloudFire NameServer. You will see the information of Nameserver that is given to you.

Copy these nameserver and jump into dashboard overview of NiagaHoster. You should replace it with NameServer of CloudFire.

After that, go to Netlify Dashboard -> open your project -> Custom domain -> Add domain that you have set previously. In thise case, you will see they're awaiting for external DNS. You will get some information such as IPv4 and domain name that you should input it to CloudFire.


Final step, go to Dashboard Cloudfire -> DNS Records -> Add record domain -> set them accordingly.
